### Premise

The Disco Tower, once a place of music and joy, is now under the control of evil AI robots who want to replace humanity. What was once a glowing beacon of dance and creativity is now a dark, cold fortress filled with machines trying to erase human art. Climb the tower and out-dance the robots to prove the greatness of human creativity and dance moves!

Disco Tower is a roguelike rhythm game that takes the core elements of an exploration game, and adds a beat-matching rhythm to it. Your actions are most effective when in sync with the beat, and keeping up your combo by moving around is critical to beating the harder levels! You can explore the dungeon, equip new items, defeat robots, and find the teleporter to move up to the next floor. The tower is procedurally generated, so every single game is different! Each robot also has their own movement patterns that you can strategize around. Even if you're entering a room full of robots, you can still destroy them by using good timing! There are a variety of weapons and armor upgrades to collect, and killing robots awards you with scrap metal.
